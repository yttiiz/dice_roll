# Dice roll

### Description

Two players compete by rolling a dice :
- The first to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.
- If the player who rolls the dice scores more than 1 point, he can reroll the dice and continue to earn points.
Otherwise, he passes his turn and loses the accumulated points.
- The player whose turn it is must decide before throwing the dice if he wishes to keep the accumulated points. If so, he passes his turn and his number of points is recorded.
